# Introduction to RTK-Query

This was created for the 17th meetup of the [React Meetup Leipzig](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/reactjs-meetup-leipzig/).

After talking about [RTKQuery](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) in the previous meetup, I wanted to provide a meaningful yet easy to get into 'Hands-On' introduction to rtk-query.

That's what this repo is there for.

## How To

First of all you should get everything ready:

```shell
    npm i
    npm run dev
```

There are multiple exercises in the `src/exercises` folder. Just look into each file in each individual folder and work through the listed TODOs :)

### Tips

Don't overdo it, easy solutions are perfectly sufficient.

You will probably need to look at the [rtk-query docs](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) constantly.

### Solutions

In case you are struggling or you simply want to verify your approach, feel free to look into the provided `src/solutions` folder :)

## Dependencies

It uses the freely accessible [restful-api](https://restful-api.dev) as a target endpoint to actually make requests.

The whole project was created using [vite](https://vitejs.dev).
